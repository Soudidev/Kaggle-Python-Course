* Imaginary numbers:
	we represent them as "i" (imaginary unit) multiplied by a real number. Ex 3i


*Complex number:
	imaginary number + real number (a+bi). Ex 2+3i

* Method:
	An objects' function is called METHOD. to access them use "dot syntax" ex. x.bit_length
	to call a method add () ex. x.bit_length()
* Attribute:
	Non-function things attached to an object, such as imag, are called attributes

*help:
	help(function) ---> Ex.  help(max)
	help(method)   ---> Ex.  help(x.bit_length)

*Tuples:
	The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets  Ex. t = (1, 2, 3)

* Numerator and Denominator:
	The fraction 3/4 is read as "three-fourths," The numerator is 3 and The denominator is 4
